# What
It's 2021, and time for our 2nd TaxonWorks Together event (6 - 10 December 2021). Join us for a week-long series of activities centered around building the [TaxonWorks](http://taxonworks.org) community.  In our second year, we'll focus on learning from those using or experimenting with TaxonWorks in their taxonomic and digitization workflows. We invite new audiences to join us to gather insights for tailoring future directions. Our week includes lots of opportunities to ask questions, meet others and learn about TaxonWorks. These activities are open events and your feedback and contributions will make a difference. Some activities will be highly guided, some information style, and some unconference style.   
 - #### Questions
   Send email to dlpaul AT illinois DOT edu
# Who
Taxonomists, ecologists, curators, collection managers, software developers, biodiversity information scientists. If you have questions about TaxonWorks this is the week to ask them. Whether you are very familiar with TaxonWorks or new to our community, all are welcome.

## Monday
### Welcome, Origins Introduction, and Logistics    

### User Perspectives on TaxonWorks
From early adopters, our newest members, and those who chose other options, join us to hear about their experiences and their needs.
### Users Perspectives Part II
A Panel Conversation. Your turn to ask questions of our speakers, and add your insights and expertise into the world of what taxonomists need from TaxonWorks.

### Brief Recap 
Today's session, this week

## Tuesday  
### Building a Community Around Your Taxonomic Needs
So you need to do something? Are you a Taxonomist describing a species? An Ecologist making a material-examined section? A Collaboration building a nomenclatural authority? A Curator? A Collection Manager? A Developer working with these data? Come discuss what you need to do, and have the TW community give you feedback on how that intersects with TaxonWorks.

A moderated discussion session, designed so that you can and add your insights and expertise into the world of what taxonomists, ecologists, collection managers, developers, and you need, from the software, from community, and each other.

### Recap and what’s next
---
### Spotlight on Nomenclatural Data
Join Dmitry Dmitriev to discover building, managing, and using nomenclatural resources and tools in TaxonWorks. See Exporting: CoLDP, CSV, DwC

### Nomenclature Discussion QA
You and invited speakers share their experiences using TaxonWorks to manage nomenclature.

## Wednesday 
### TaxonWorks, Origins, Milestones, and What’s Next
Ever wonder, why TaxonWorks? What makes TaxonWorks unique? In this 30 minute session, we’ll learn about the history, where we’re at right now, and the future of TaxonWorks and look for your insights and feedback.

### BBQ Time - You Drive the Development of TaxonWorks Software
Using “versioning” software like GitHub, we democratize software development and direction. Join us for this Barbeque (well, you’ll have to bring your own eats) to actively work with the developers to add features, fix bugs, and prioritize what gets worked on. Oh, and emojis are involved.

### Recap and what’s next
---
### Discover Matrices in TaxonWorks
So many characters, see how the tools in TaxonWorks support the taxonomist and systematist’s workflows. Invited presenters share how these matrices tools support their research. Join us to learn from them and add your insights.
### TaxonWorks LateNite  

Well, late for those of us in CST, but for you, we look forward to an international group from many time zones. In this informal session, there will be time to chat about TaxonWorks, but also any topics you bring with you to the open table.  

## Thursday  
### Focus on Digitization in TaxonWorks
This is an introduction to the world of digitization in TaxonWorks. From working with images to Comprehensive Digitization to grid digitizing. (Check out some [introductory YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKNr7QYwvVFcRfQAcMEAhLw/videos)). We'll focus on management and special highlights such as staged images, the new image task, loan management, creating new collecting events, and of course, getting data in and out of TW.

This is a great section for those new to TaxonWorks.

### Explore the New DwC Importer
Your opportunity to see the new DwC Importer. See what features are different. You'll submit a github ticket and learn to add to the issue tracker and get a sandbox account. What has to happen to get data into TW? Join us to learn.

### Recap  
Thank you all for attending, and what’s next

## Friday
### It’s Developer Time
Could be coffee, could be tea, but in unconference style, all the discussion and activities stay focused on topics such as installing TW, the TW data model, the API, and perhaps some work to link the TW API, or developing a requested Page feature.

Some possible topics of interest include: USB booting with TW, work to make stuff faster, import/export, data visualization, and new API features
